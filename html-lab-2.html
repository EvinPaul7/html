		<p><b>Noida</b> is a suburb on the outskirts of India's national capital, New Delhi, and within a matter of seconds, it has witnessed the demolition of 2 skyscrapers, the Supertech twin towers. The towers were reduced to rubble today with help of 3700 kg explosives.</p>

        <p>Supertech twin towers in Noida were demolished on last Sunday (August 28). The buildings were demolished as they violated rules. The real estate company now says it will submit a proposal before the Noida development authority to develop a housing project there and also take consent of RWA of Emerald Court, if needed. However, residents of the Emerald Court housing society said they would object to any attempt by builder Supertech Group to construct another housing tower at the spot.</p>

        <p>“We were allotted 14 acre of land by Noida authority in Noida Sector 93 A for the development of the group housing project. Out of the total land parcel, the twin towers were built on 2 acre land. Now the twin towers have been demolished, we will submit a plan to develop a group housing project on the 2-acre land which is owned by the company," Supertech Chairman R K Arora told PTI.</p>
